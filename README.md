# Limiting-API-Calls-Server-using-Nodejs
Rate limiting protects your APIs from overuse by limiting how often each user can call the API. This protects them from inadvertent or malicious overuse. Without rate limiting, each user may request as often as they like, leading to “spikes” of requests that starve other consumers.
In case a client made too many requests within a given time frame, HTTP servers can respond with Status code: 429, Too Many Requests.
